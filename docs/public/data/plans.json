      "title": "Containerization: Composition NOT Inheritance in Swift",
      "preface": "Composition replaces inheritance throughout the framework: Alert, Dialog, Panel, and Card all use the `renderContainer()` helper rather than inheriting from ContainerView. List and Table will follow the same pattern with `renderListWithFocus()` and `renderTableWithFocus()` helpers plus shared `FocusableItemListHandler`. This ensures consistency, maximizes code reuse, and keeps view definitions simple (plain structs) while rendering logic lives in testable helper functions — true to SwiftUI/TUIKit's design philosophy."

      "title": "ContainerView Refactoring Plan",
      "preface": "ContainerView is being refactored from the broken `body: Never` + Renderable pattern to a proper View with `body: some View` that returns an internal `_ContainerViewCore`. This fix enables modifiers to work naturally and becomes the template for fixing List, Box, and other components. Once done, `.foregroundColor()`, `.padding()`, and other standard modifiers will compose correctly instead of being silently ignored."

      "title": "Implementation Plan: ContainerView Refactoring",
      "preface": "ContainerView is fixed by extracting its 400+ lines of rendering logic into a private `_ContainerViewCore` struct, making `ContainerView` a simple public View with `body: some View` that creates the core. This restores modifier support, enables proper view composition, and establishes the correct pattern for refactoring List, Box, and all other components in the framework."

      "title": "Implementation Plan: List & Table (Refactored)",
      "preface": "List and Table are both implemented using proper View architecture: public View with `body: some View`, private `_ListCore`/`_TableCore` containing all rendering logic. Both share focus navigation via `FocusableItemListHandler` and selection state via `SelectionStateManager`, with helpers like `renderFocusableContainer()` preventing code duplication. This establishes the consistent, reusable pattern for List and Table while becoming a reference for future components."

      "preface": "Shared focus/selection infrastructure is extracted so both List and Table reuse the same pieces: `FocusableItemListHandler` for keyboard navigation (Up/Down/Home/End), `SelectionStateManager<T>` for tracking selected values, `ItemStateRenderer` for styling based on focus/selection state, and `renderFocusableContainer()` helper that orchestrates layout + styling + scrolling."

      "preface": "`Toggle` adds interactive on/off controls to TUI apps with SwiftUI API parity: `Binding<Bool>`, label as ViewBuilder or String, two styles (toggle slider `[●○]`/`[○●]` and checkbox `[x]`/`[ ]`). Space/Enter toggles the value. Focused indicators show via pulsing ● dot. Supports `.disabled()` modifier. Works perfectly alongside Button and Menu as part of the core input component set."

      "preface": "Block and Flat appearances are both removed (36 files changed). The framework now offers four border-based appearances: line, rounded, doubleLine, heavy — all using standard Unicode box-drawing characters. Surface color tokens are consolidated into `Palette` directly (no more `BlockPalette` protocol). Simplified architecture, eliminated half-block complexity that broke on many terminals, and gained universal compatibility using only ANSI backgrounds and standard borders."

Supports `BinaryFloatingPoint` values with total, ViewBuilder label closures, and currentValueLabel for custom percentage display. Optional `.disabled()` modifier, proper width clamping, and edge-case handling for nil/negative/overflow values."

      "title": "Render Performance Phase 2: Memoization Activation & Debug Tooling",
      "preface": "Subtree memoization is activated: environment snapshot comparison in `RenderLoop` automatically invalidates cache on theme/palette changes; core types (Text, Alignment, ContainerConfig, etc.) gain `Equatable` conformance; example app extracts view subcomponents and applies `.equatable()` for real cache benefit. Debug logging (via `TUIKIT_DEBUG_RENDER` env var) tracks cache hits/misses per identity. Between state changes, identical views now skip re-rendering entirely."

      "preface": "Social lookup script is optimized to eliminate false positives: instance validation via NodeInfo (confirms domains run ActivityPub software), expanded blocklist for link-in-bio services, leading-`@` requirement for Mastodon handles (rejects corporate emails), and preservation of `verified: true` for authoritative sources (GitHub profile, Keybase, manual overrides). Full refresh overwrites stale entries. 21 known Mastodon instances searched. Cleaner cache, no manual corrections needed."
