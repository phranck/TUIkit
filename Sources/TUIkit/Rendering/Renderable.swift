//  🖥️ TUIKit — Terminal UI Kit for Swift
//  Renderable.swift
//
//  Created by LAYERED.work
//  License: MIT

/// A protocol for views that produce terminal output directly.
///
/// TUIkit uses a **dual rendering system** inspired by SwiftUI:
///
/// - **`View.body`** — Compositional path: views declare *what* they
///   are made of by composing other `View` types.
/// - **`Renderable.renderToBuffer`** — Primitive path: views define
///   *how* they look by producing a ``FrameBuffer`` directly.
///
/// When the free function ``renderToBuffer(_:context:)`` encounters a
/// view, it checks `Renderable` conformance **first**. If the view
/// conforms, `renderToBuffer(context:)` is called and `body` is never
/// consulted. Only if the view is *not* `Renderable` does the function
/// recurse into `body`.
///
/// ## Who conforms to Renderable?
///
/// - **Leaf views**: `Text`, `EmptyView`, `Spacer`, `Divider`
/// - **Layout containers**: `VStack`, `HStack`, `ZStack`
/// - **ViewBuilder glue**: `TupleView`, `ConditionalView`, `ViewArray`
/// - **Interactive views**: `Button`, `ButtonRow`, `Menu`, `StatusBar`
/// - **Containers**: `Panel`, `ContainerView`, `Alert`, `Dialog`, `Card`
/// - **Modifiers**: `ModifiedView`, `DimmedModifier`, etc.
///
/// All of these declare `body: Never` (which `fatalError`s) because
/// their rendering is fully handled by `Renderable`.
///
/// ## Composite views (body only)
///
/// Views that do **not** conform to `Renderable` use `body` to compose
/// other views. Example: ``Box`` returns `content.border(...)` from its
/// `body`, delegating rendering to ``ContainerView`` which *is* `Renderable`.
///
/// ## Adding a new view type
///
/// - If your view composes other views → implement `body`, skip `Renderable`.
/// - If your view produces terminal output directly → conform to `Renderable`
///   and set `body: Never`.
/// - **Warning**: A view with `body: Never` that does *not* conform to
///   `Renderable` will silently render as empty. There is no runtime error.

// MARK: - Rendering Dispatch

/// Renders any `View` into a ``FrameBuffer`` using the dual rendering system.
///
/// This is the **single entry point** for all view rendering in TUIkit.
/// Every recursive call in the view tree passes through this function.
///
/// ## Decision order
///
/// 1. **Renderable** — If the view conforms to ``Renderable``, call
///    `renderToBuffer(context:)` directly. The `body` property is
///    never accessed.
/// 2. **Body recursion** — If the view does *not* conform to `Renderable`
///    and its `Body` type is not `Never`, recurse into `view.body`.
/// 3. **Empty fallback** — If neither applies (`Body` is `Never` and no
///    `Renderable` conformance), return an empty ``FrameBuffer``.
///    This is a silent no-op — no error, no warning.
///
/// ## Example flow
///
/// ```
/// renderToBuffer(Box { Text("Hi") })
///   → Box is NOT Renderable, Body != Never
///   → recurse into Box.body → ContainerView
///     → ContainerView IS Renderable
///     → calls ContainerView.renderToBuffer(context:)
///       → internally calls renderToBuffer(Text("Hi"), context:)
///         → Text IS Renderable → produces FrameBuffer
/// ```

///   - view: The view to render.
///   - context: The rendering context with layout constraints.
/// - Returns: A ``FrameBuffer`` containing the rendered terminal output.
